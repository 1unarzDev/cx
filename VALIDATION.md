# Validation record

Each result distinguishes implemented code, fixture tests, PTY tests and physical hardware. No acceptance gate is complete merely because its code compiles. Sensitive local evidence is outside tracked files.

| Gate | Status | Evidence / limit |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | PASS | 2026-10-05 bounded BatchMode SSH, 6-second connection timeout: innovation→tranquility peace, innovation→server lunarz; tranquility→innovation lunarz, tranquility→server lunarz; server→innovation lunarz, server→tranquility peace. Server peace alias also resolves tranquility. Innovation self-alias fails host-key verification; not one of six directed fleet edges. |
| A2 | BLOCKED | No authorized repository/release; bootstrap pipeline must be prepared and tested as a fixture, not advertised as public installation. |
| A3–A16 | BLOCKED | Not yet exercised; implementation and tests in progress. |

Baseline inventory at f30bfa2/8619484: innovation tmux 3.7c, Codex 0.160.1, Claude 2.1.290; tranquility tmux initially absent/npm installed; server Ubuntu 24.04 tmux 3.4, codex/claude absent. Tranquility dependency extracted as user from tmux 3.7_c-1 and libutempter 1.2.3-1 packages, both verified by pacman-key with fully trusted Arch packaging signatures. No system package or privilege mutation.

Provider observation: configured Codex provider codex-lb uses HTTPS /backend-api/codex; codex-lb Docker container runs on host network. Unauthenticated /health gives HTTP 200 (transport evidence only). Claude /health returns HTTP 302; this does not establish provider readiness. No inference health requests made.
